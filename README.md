# Calendar
As for my calendar, it was pretty minimal, barebones, and unpolished.
In the end, i used fullcalendar js plugin.

# Leetcode/Short passion project
python stuff includes some leetcode and my passion project, 
counter.py
I've applied what i know about of asynchronous/multithreaded programming
This program records the time spent typing, 
it uses 3 threads of execution, concurrently executing infinite loops, 
1st is for periodically logging into txt file
2nd is for recording duration of typing sessions, sessions are a few seconds apart
3rd is for periodic timer for seperating typing sessions, so idle time is not recorded
