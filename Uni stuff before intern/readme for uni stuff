Tere should be many stuff i wanna showcase here during uni,
but my laptop broke, right now not much spare time/money to fix it.

I would've put plenty of my past assignments like 
1. java
2. c# i used for unity
3. c++
4. python jupyter notebook
5. visual basic
6. illustrator & photoshop (this folder has a psd file w/ my name https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Akd-VM17f7kGYppLG3dXx0sYFLmRt9-s/view?usp=drivesdk )

I'll try to add whatever i can
